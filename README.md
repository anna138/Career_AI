# Career_AI
Machine Learning on prediction of careers based on personality traits. 

Model uses scikitlearn with Python.

I am in charge of ML with another teammate for a senior capstone project to predict a person's 
best career choice and optimize their success through monitoring their weaknesses. 
Attached are files that I have written to try and predict career choice through persoanlity traits 
of Big 5 which is backed up by psychology research.

Out next step in this research is to look at NLP to determine whether or not we can predict a person's
Myers Briggs persona to determine their best career choice through samples of their writing. 

This is still an ongoing project with a team of 4 people, including me. Two of us are doing back end and 
machine learning. The other two teammates are front end.
